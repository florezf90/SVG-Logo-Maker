  # üë©‚Äçüíª About

The present application has been created with the propuse of practicing new concepts learned, such as:

* OOP (Object Oriented Programming

* Modulize (being able to organize the application files by class names)

* Run test.js files, which allows to make sure that the code created works as supposed.

The SVG file generator, allows the user to create a unique basic logo that represents your a personal brand in very few steps, by just entering 1-3 letters that you want to include in your logo. Based on your input, the generator will produce a range of logo designs for you to choose from.

# üí≤Built With 


* JavaScript

* Node.js

* npm MaxLengthInputPrompt 

* npm Jest 

* npm Inquirer

---------------------------------

# üöÄ Installation 

1.First, to generate your own README, `git clone` the repo down to your local machine by running on the command line :

     git clone git@github.com:florezf90/SVG-Logo-Maker.git

Once the repo is cloned, initialize the JSON packages by running:

     npm i

 NOTE: please make sure to have installed node.js on your local machine


 -----------------------------
 # üìñ Usage

Once the repo and the NPM Inquirer has been installed, make sure that you open the terminal from the right directory, and then, to run the application, try on your command line :


              node index.js


It  will prompt from the command line the required inputs to personalize the SVG logo, once all of those are answered, there is going to be generated a new SVG file in the exmple directory, which content will vary based on the inputs given. You can right-click on the file and select the option "open in live server" and it will open a new window in your browser with the generated ICON.
